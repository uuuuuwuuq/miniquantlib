## Usage

Using MiniQuantLib is straightforward. Below are some examples to get you started.

### Vector Operations

```cpp
#include "miniquantlib/vector.h"

int main() {
    Vector v1(3);
    Vector v2(3);

    v1[0] = 1.0; v1[1] = 2.0; v1[2] = 3.0;
    v2[0] = 4.0; v2[1] = 5.0; v2[2] = 6.0;

    Vector v3 = v1 + v2; // Vector addition
    // v3 now contains [5.0, 7.0, 9.0]
}
```

### Matrix Operations

```cpp
#include "miniquantlib/matrix.h"

int main() {
    Matrix m1(2, 2);
    Matrix m2(2, 2);

    m1(0, 0) = 1; m1(0, 1) = 2;
    m1(1, 0) = 3; m1(1, 1) = 4;

    m2(0, 0) = 5; m2(0, 1) = 6;
    m2(1, 0) = 7; m2(1, 1) = 8;

    Matrix m3 = m1 * m2; // Matrix multiplication
    // m3 now contains [[19, 22], [43, 50]]
}
```

### Template Metaprogramming

MiniQuantLib utilizes C++ templates to allow for type-safe operations. This ensures that your code is both efficient and easy to read.

```cpp
template<typename T>
T dot_product(const Vector<T>& v1, const Vector<T>& v2) {
    T result = 0;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < v1.size(); ++i) {
        result += v1[i] * v2[i];
    }
    return result;
}
```
